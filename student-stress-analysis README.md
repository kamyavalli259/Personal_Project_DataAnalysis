# Exploring Factors Affecting Student Stress Levels

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how different factors like sleep quality, headache frequency, academic performance, study load, and extracurricular activity frequency impact student stress levels. Using a dataset of student responses, the project cleans the data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and trains a Random Forest Regression model to predict stress levels.

## Features
- Cleaned and standardized dataset
- Handled missing values and ensured correct data types
- Visualized distributions and relationships between variables
- Predicted student stress levels using Random Forest Regression
- Evaluated model performance with MSE and RMSE

## Results
- Random Forest Regression achieved:
  - MSE: 0.192
  - RMSE: 0.438
- The model shows moderate accuracy in predicting stress levels based on the selected features.
